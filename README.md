# A Time Sensitive network Switch Implementation using Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors (P4)
# Introduction
Final year research project to design a programmable virtual switch based on the specifications of TSN to be implemented on a TSN network (in Mininet) comprised of various TSN switches and a network controller.

The research project is submitted to the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Cape Town in partial fulfilment of the academic requirements for a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering

# Instructions

The TSN switch and the network designed are implemented on Mininet using P4. P4 is a high-level network programming language that defines packet-processing pipelines and forwarding rules on programmable switches. The network is comprised of three V1model architectural P4 BMv2 software switches to which the P4 program is written to, 5 hosts and a P4Runtime controller. The network topology is shown below:
